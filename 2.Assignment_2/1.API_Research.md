## Twitter_API:

- ### URL Structure:

  - #### Base URL: The Twitter API follows a hierarchical URL structure, with a base URL of https://api.twitter.com.

  - #### API Version: The Twitter API is versioned, and the version is specified in the URL. The current version is Twitter API v2.

  - #### Endpoint: The endpoint represents the specific functionality or resource you want to access. It is appended to the base URL and API version. For example, to access an individual user, the endpoint would be /2/users/:id.

  - #### Query Parameters: Query parameters are used to provide additional information or filter the API request. They are appended to the endpoint URL using the ? symbol, followed by the parameter key-value pairs.

  Here's an example of a complete Twitter API URL structure:

  ```
  https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/:id?expansions=attachments.media_keys&media.fields
  ```

- ### Resource Naming Conventions:

  The Twitter API uses consistent resource naming conventions. This makes it easy to identify the different types of resources that are available on the API.

  ```
  /tweets - This resource represents a collection of tweets.

  /users - This resource represents a collection of users.

  /users/:id - This resource represents a single user, where :id is the user ID.

  /tweets/:id - This resource represents a single tweet, where :id is the tweet ID.

  /search/tweets - This resource allows searching for tweets that match a specified query.
  ```

  These resource URLs represent the core endpoints in the Twitter API for accessing tweets, users, and performing search operations.

- ### HTTP Methods Usage:

  The Twitter API utilizes appropriate HTTP methods for different operations. Here are some examples of HTTP methods used in the Twitter API:

  ```
  GET: Used for retrieving resources, such as retrieving tweets, user profiles, follower lists, etc.

  POST: Used for creating resources, such as creating tweets, following or unfollowing users, etc.

  PUT: This method is used to update data on the API, such as updating user profiles or or to change password.

  DELETE: Used for deleting resources, such as deleting tweets or removing followers.
  ```

- ### Error Handling:

  Errors in the Twitter API are conveyed through standard HTTP status codes and detailed error messages in the response body. Common status codes such as 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, and 429 Too Many Requests are utilized to indicate different types of errors, providing developers with a quick understanding of the error type.

  The error response body accompanying these status codes contains additional information to assist developers in identifying and resolving issues. It includes crucial details like the error message, error code, and potentially other relevant information. By parsing the error response, developers can extract specific error details and implement appropriate error handling strategies.

- ### Authentication Mechanisms:

  Twitter API authentication mechanisms are used to verify the identity of the user or application making a request to the API. There are two main types of authentication mechanisms OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0.

  OAuth 2.0 is a newer authentication mechanism that is becoming increasingly popular.

  - The user authorizes the application to access their Twitter data.
  - The application obtains an authorization code from Twitter.
  - The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token and secret.
  - The application uses the access token and secret to make requests to the Twitter API.

## GitHub_API:

- ### URL Structure:

  The GitHub API has a consistent URL structure. The base URL for the API is https://api.github.com/, and endpoints are appended to this base URL to access specific resources and perform operations.

- ### Resource Naming Conventions:

  The GitHub API uses consistent resource naming conventions. All resources are nouns, and they are all lowercase. For example:

  ```
  Repositories: The endpoint to access repositories is /repos/:owner/:repo, where :owner is the username or organization and :repo is the repository name.

  Issues: The endpoint for issues is /repos/:owner/:repo/issues, allowing access to issues for a specific repository.

  Pull Requests: The pull requests endpoint is /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls, providing access to the pull requests for a particular repository.
  ```

- ### HTTP methods usage:

  ```
  GET: Used for retrieving resources, such as fetching information about repositories, issues, or users.

  POST: Used for creating new resources, such as creating a new repository, issue, or comment.

  PATCH: Used for updating existing resources, allowing modifications to repositories, issues, or pull requests.

  DELETE: Used for deleting resources, such as deleting a repository, issue, or comment.
  ```

- ### Error handling:

  The GitHub API follows the standard HTTP status codes to indicate errors. For instance, a 400 Bad Request status code signifies an invalid request, a 401 Unauthorized status code indicates the need for authentication, a 404 Not Found status code indicates that the requested resource couldn't be found, and a 429 Too Many Requests status code suggests that the user has exceeded the API rate limit. These status codes provide developers with a quick understanding of the error type, aiding in identifying the underlying cause of the issue.

  When an error occurs in the GitHub API, it responds with an error message in JSON format. The error response typically includes a brief description of the error in the 'message' field and a 'documentation_url' pointing to relevant documentation for further information on handling the specific error. By examining the error response, developers can extract the error message and refer to the provided documentation URL for guidance on how to handle and resolve the error effectively.

- ### Authentication Mechanisms:

  GitHub API supports various authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to resources:

  ```
  - Personal Access Token (PAT): Developers can generate a PAT and use it as a token-based authentication method when making API requests.

  - OAuth 2.0: GitHub API also supports OAuth 2.0 authentication, allowing applications to request authorization from users and obtain access tokens to authenticate API requests.
  ```

## Stripe_API:

- ### URL Structure:

  The base URL for the Stripe API is https://api.stripe.com/, and endpoints are appended to this base URL to access specific resources and perform operations.

- ### Resource Naming Conventions:

  The Stripe API uses logical and descriptive resource names that align with payment-related concepts.

  ```
  /v1/charges - This resource represents the action of charging a customer for a payment.

  /v1/customers - This resource allows for managing customer information and associated payment details.

  /v1/subscriptions - Â This resource provides functionality for managing recurring subscription plans.
  ```

- ### HTTP Methods Usage:

  The Stripe API utilizes appropriate HTTP methods for different operations:

  ```
  GET: Used for retrieving resources, such as fetching information about charges, customers, or subscriptions.

  POST: Used for creating new resources, like creating a charge, customer, or subscription.

  PUT or PATCH: Used for updating existing resources, allowing modifications to charges, customers, or subscriptions.

  DELETE: Used for deleting resources, such as canceling a subscription or removing a customer.
  ```

- ### Error Handling:

  Stripe API implements conventional HTTP response codes to signify the outcome of an API request. Typically, HTTP status codes in the 2xx range indicate a successful response. On the other hand, codes in the 4xx range indicate errors related to the provided information, such as missing required parameters or failed charges. It's important to note that codes in the 5xx range are rare and indicate errors on Stripe's servers.

  When an error occurs in the Stripe API, developers receive an error response in JSON format. The response includes essential information such as the error type, a descriptive error message, a specific error code for programmatic handling, and the associated parameter, if applicable. By examining this error response, developers can extract the error message and handle the specific error accordingly. Additionally, referring to the documentation URL provided in the response can offer further guidance on how to handle the specific error and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

- ### Authentication Mechanisms:

  Stripe API authentication is primarily done using API keys. These keys are used to authenticate requests made to the Stripe API. There are different types of API keys: Publishable Keys and Secret Keys. Publishable Keys are used on the client side, while Secret Keys should be kept confidential and used on the server side.

  Test mode secret keys have the prefix "sk*test*" and live mode secret keys have the prefix "sk*live*". Stripe also provides restricted API keys that offer granular permissions.

  It's important to keep API keys secure and not share them in publicly accessible areas like GitHub or client-side code.

  Authentication to the API is done using HTTP Basic Auth. The API key is provided as the basic auth username, and no password is required.

  For bearer auth, which is used for cross-origin requests, the API key can be passed as the Authorization header using the "Bearer" scheme.

  All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Making requests over plain HTTP will fail, and requests without authentication will also fail.

  By following these authentication guidelines, users can ensure the secure and proper usage of the Stripe API in their integrations.
