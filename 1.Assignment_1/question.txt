Subject: Make our algorithm live using REST API
Description: Please select one or many algorithm ideas from the below list and create a rest api out of it -

1. We have a function that can take two arguments called start and end. Both arguments will be a valid integer number. The function will return a random value in the given range.

2. We have a function that can generate a fake person profile including first name, last name, email, avatar, age and address. User can pass an array of selected properties and it will return a person object containing only given properties. Ex: generatePerson([’firstName’, ‘lastName’, ‘email’])

3. We have a function that can accept a string as an argument and return an object containing the number of letters, number of symbols and number of numeric characters.
You must have to keep business logic and API logic separate.
